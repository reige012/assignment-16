# Task2

Write a program that does something you need (or want) for it to do. The program can do anything, but it should have between 5 and 10 functions (or more, if you really want). You should also write a separate set of unit tests for your program to test that each function is performing as you would expect. You may use any sort of input data you like (your own, someone elses, etc.). If you want some data you could do stuff with, there are many sources online... one of my recent favorites is this set of natural history traits of different organisms.

Be sure to trim your input data file to a reasonable size before committing it to your repository (git does not like to store large, unchanging, files). Please also include, in a README.md file in your repository, a description of what your program does and how to use it.

  - Program is correctly formatted (1.0 pt)
  - Program includes at least 5-10 functions (2.5 pt)
  - Program functions correctly (2.5 pt)
  - There are also a set of unittests that go along with program (1.5 pt)
  - unittests function correctly, and all pass (1.5 pt)
  - Program includes documentation in the form of a README.md in the repository (2 pt)

We use the Markdown format to write this readme.md. Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

In this program, i plan to achieve several aims.
 - 1. read a sequencing file with argparse. 
 - 2. make it to string
 - 3. each character separate with whitespace.
 - 4. replace N to A.
 - 5. find the position of first T.
 - 6. replace to lower case.
 - 7. eliminate all the paragraph marker.
 - 8. count all the ATGC number.
 - 9. practice for project.
