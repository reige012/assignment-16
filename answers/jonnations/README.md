Assignment 16 Task 2

The purpose of this task is to perform 5 basic methods on a large string text. In order, this counts the periods, finds the position of a word, splits the string, lowercases words, and replaces words. The code can be modified by inserting any text string, then replaceing-all from 'galapagos' to the name of the text string you inserted in the main().

Note: Originally this was going to be a program that performed simple statistics on data from the Amniote Database, but it led to a pandas wormhole where I figured out how EASY it is to find the mean, median, max, etc — Series.mean() for example — and I didn't know how to test that.
