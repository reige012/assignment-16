#Task 2
This file is to manipulate a csv. It will take in the file Swamp_tests.csv and
sort the columns, transpose the dataframe, delete a column, evaluate the OTU
over 10 reads, and find the mean of the OTU reads. This is done using Pandas.
Because of errors with testing in Pandas see:http://penandpants.com/2014/10/07/testing-with-numpy-and-pandas/
I was not able to readily create a working test feature. You will most likely get
errors that the tests failed because of this.
